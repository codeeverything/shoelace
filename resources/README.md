## Coding Standards

A list of various useful coding standards to follow in your development:

- PHP
  - [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), [PSR-5](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/fig-standards/tree/master/proposed) (draft), [PSR-12](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/extended-coding-style-guide.md) (draft)
- Javascript
  - [Airbnb native ES5](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5)
  - [Airbnb native ES6](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  - [Airbnb React](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/react)

When implementing coding standards it's often useful to build these into your continuous integration process as well to ensure these are followed. As an example see the [Jenkins CI w/PHP Ansible project]() in this repo.
